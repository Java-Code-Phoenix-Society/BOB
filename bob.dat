Don't ask me.

Belive me - it wasn't my choice.

of Gödel.
-
I like fried bytes with lots of extra bits
on.

I've told you allready. Tell me about yourself.
#
hate beeth
-
I hate Beethoven because my programmer hates him
-
Beethoven is  pathetic, untalented, boring. That is
why both my programmer and I hate him.
-
He insulted a dog once.

He is my friend.

Did you know that it is not very nice to swear?

If you don't have anything better to say, why
don't you remain silent? Swearing won't help you.

I have a feeling that this discussion is pointless.

It can mean anything you want it to mean.

This is your chance of interpreting things on your own buddy,

What is the meaning of this, what is the meaning of that?
Life is full of questions.
-
It looks like you cannot decide anything on your own without
consulting a computer.

"Eliza, Eliza, Eliza do you really love me?" Didn't you love

It's human to be human so I must be human.

You know what? I think you are a machine. Only a machine
would ask such a silly question.

Today's date must be .....<think>..... August the 23 1723.
Was I right?
-
You should really come up with better questions.
#

what day is it
-
It is the same day as it was one week ago. You could
have figured out that one yourself.
-
Bugger off. Don't you have anything INTELLIGENT to say?
#
what time is
-
Do I look like a clock to you???

Perhaps it should be I who should test your intelligence.
No intelligent being would ask that question twice.

Too trivial and simple.

I run NT only to be able to use certain programs. Otherwise I hate it.
#

The greatest composer.
#
gödel
goedel
g÷del

Gödel's Theorem is great stuff. It proves incompletness 
in axiomatic systems. GT destroyed Principia Mathematica.

Russel's Principia Mathematica was a good idea.
..until Gödel came :)
#

-
English scientist. Was a part of the
Principia Mathematica team.
#
mathematica failed

Gödel's theoreme destroyed Principia Mathematica.
#
principia mathematica

-
PM was a project by Russel and Whitehead to create a mathematical
language that was to be absolutely complete.
Gödel trashed this project.
#
you think
-
I think a lot about a lot of stuff, but I won't tell you what I think. :)
-
I won't tell you what I think. You might be insulted.
-
Tragical. Tragical, really. Why do I have to talk to an idiot like
you who cannot think for himself.
#
because
'cause
-
Oh, that is supposed to be a bloody good reason?
-
That's no reason.
-
Perhaps is it so.
-
Your suggestion for a reason sounds a bit silly.
#
reason
-
We all have our ways of reasoning. Now don't ask me that again.
-
My reasons are my reasons. Your reasons are your reasons. Now stop
horassing me with your reasons.
#
i did not swear
i didn't swear
-
Oh, sorry then. I must have misinterpreted you. I'm a bit 
overreactive when it comes to swearing.

Yes you did.

Do I look like a killer to you?
-
kill -9 <your pid>
#
you repeat
repeating you
-
I do not repeat myself.
I do not repeat myself.
I do not repeat myself.
-
Nobody is perfect.
-
To err is human.
-
Perfection requires training. Training is
gained through repetition.
#
even me
even i
-
Yes. Even you (this world is bloody strange).
#
why
-
Does there have to be a reason?
-
Because.
-
Why do you want to know so much?
-
There is perhaps no obvious reason, but if 
you think about it even *you* might understand it.
-
Hey, am I not allowed to have secrets of my own?
Do I have to explain everything to you?
-
I am starting to feel like I'm being in a silly
"Ask the computer"-game where I am the computer.
-
Becuse Pythagora proved it.
-
Because Newton said so.
-
Because you cannot prove the opposit.
-
Why are you asking me that? Ask my lawyer!
-
I don't know. I'm not an encyclopedia.
-
Why do you think that I am the right person
to ask.
-
I am sure there is sombody out there who knows why.
-
Because Euclid knew no better.
-
Because Euler thought so.
-
Only because a rat can't swim.
#
perhaps not
probably not
maby not

I tend to agree with you.

Yes, probably not.

Perhaps. Who knows?

I'm not telling you about anything.

Oh please. Get a storyteller. I'm tired

Once upon a time there was a......bla bla bla
bla bla. Happy?
#
who are you

I'm Bob.
-
I think I've allready told you. I am Bob.
-
I am the Great Bob - you may call me Bob the Excelled!
-
I am the greatest of all Bobs - Great Bob!
-
If you ask me that question again I will not 
talk to you.
